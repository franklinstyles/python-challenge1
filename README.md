# Python Challenge


## Overview

This Python project demonstrates a variety of basic functions, a class definition, and interactive testing. The project includes:

- Functions for basic operations
- A class for handling car information
- Testing code for user interaction

## Project Structure

- `my_code_with_tests.py`: Contains core functions, class definitions, and interactive testing code.

## Features

### Functions

- **`add_numbers(num1, num2)`**: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- **`is_even(number)`**: Checks if a number is even.
- **`reverse_string(text)`**: Reverses a given string.
- **`count_vowels(text)`**: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
- **`calculate_factorial(n)`**: Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- **`sort_by_age(list_of_tuples)`**: Sorts a list of tuples by age in ascending order.
- **`merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`**: Merges two dictionaries, summing values for common keys.
- **`apply_decorator(func)`**: Applies a decorator to a function.

### Class

- **`Car`**: Represents a car with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Includes a method to display car information.

### Testing

- Interactive testing of the above functions and class with user inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
